- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @eliotlencelot.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in (too?) many things, ha, ha ! One of them is physics and the other is, of course, computer science. Here you will find some repositories about Machine Learning, Physics (Plasma physics, Particle In Cell simulations, Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations, ...), both Physics and ML, and a bit of archiving.
- ðŸŒ± I love snow : it makes the landscape incredible and one can ski on it. I'm a very curious mind, it is my joy to learn and to understand new things.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via email, I'm open to work: _eliotlencelot [gmail] com_
